Using the following diagram as a base:


Employee
dni: int
name: string
surname: string
salary: double
annualSalary(): float
increaseSalary(float percentage): void
getDescription(): string


Model the Employee object with the following characteristics: dni, name, surname, and salary. The object should be able to calculate the annual salary and have a method that allows increasing the salary based on the percentage passed as a parameter. Consider creating a method that facilitates printing the object's characteristics on the screen in the following format:
Employee[dni=?, name=?, surname=?, salary=?]



a. Initialize an employee, Carlos Gutierrez, with dni 23456345 and an initial salary of 25000.
b. Initialize an employee, Ana Sanchez, with dni 34234123 and an initial salary of 27500.
c. Print both objects on the screen.
d. Increase Carlos's salary by 15% and print his annual salary on the screen.
